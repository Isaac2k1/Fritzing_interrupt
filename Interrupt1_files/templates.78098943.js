Create Terms of Service\n        \n\nLast updated: May 20, 2016\n\n\nPlease read these Terms of Service carefully before using the create.arduino.cc website.\n\n\n1. Acceptance of Terms.\n\nBy using the Arduino Create Web site (the “Site”) in any way, including using, transmitting, downloading, or uploading any of the services or functionality (the “Service”) made available or enabled via the Site by BCMI Labs SA, or merely browsing the Site, you agree to these Terms of Service. You may not use the Service, or accept these Terms of Service, if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with BCMI Labs SA; or (b) you are prohibited by law from receiving or using the Service. If you are entering into these Terms of Service on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to these Terms of Service, in which case “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. BCMI Labs SA makes the Service available only if you have registered for an account. The Service may also be subject to a subscription or other agreement, posted guidelines, rules or terms of service (“Additional Terms”). If there is any conflict between these Terms of Service and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms take precedence in relation to the Service. These Terms of Service, and any applicable Additional Terms, are referred to collectively as the “Terms.”\n\n\n2. Modification of the Terms.\n\nBCMI Labs SA may change the Terms from time to time at its sole discretion, and if BCMI Labs SA makes any substantial changes, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us and/or by posting notice of the change on the Site. Any material changes to these Terms will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Site. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Site or Service. BCMI Labs SA may require you to provide consent to the updated Terms in a specified manner before further use of the Service is permitted. Otherwise, your continued use of the Site or the Service constitutes your acceptance of the changes. Please regularly check the Site to view the then-current Terms.\n\n\n3.

Payments must be made monthly in advance unless otherwise mutually agreed upon. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid are nonrefundable. You must provide BCMI Labs SA with a valid credit card or valid online payment account information as a condition to registering for the Service.

BCMI Labs SA charges and collects in advance for use of the Service. BCMI Labs SA will automatically renew and bill your credit card or online payment account each month. The renewal charge will be equal to the License Fee in effect during the prior month, unless the BCMI Labs SA has given you at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of a fee increase, which shall be effective upon renewal and thereafter. Any amounts not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum legal rate, if less. BCMI Labs SA shall be entitled to withhold performance and discontinue Service until all amounts due are paid in full. BCMI Labs SA’s fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only taxes based solely on BCMI Labs SA’s income. You agree to provide BCMI Labs SA with complete and accurate billing and contact information. This information includes your legal company name, street address, e-mail address and name and telephone number of an authorized billing contact and Project Administrator. You agree to update this information within thirty (30) days of any change to it. If the contact information you have provided is false or fraudulent, BCMI Labs SA may terminate your access to the Service in addition to any other legal remedies.  \n\n\n6.3  Named Users. You are responsible for paying for the number of Named Users designated in your account, whether or not the Named Users use the Services. You may add Named Users by designating the number of Named Users you desire in your account. Added Named Users will be subject to the following: (a) the fee applicable to Named Users after such addition will be the then-current fee set forth on the Site applicable to the total number of Named Users designated in your account and (b) any increase to the fees as a result of the addition of a Named User in the middle of a billing month will be charged in full for that billing month. You may transfer a Named User license to another User, provided that you may not exceed the number of Named Users for which you have paid the applicable License Fees. You acknowledge that if you have been designated as a Named User by another User (“Paying User”), notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, BCMI Labs SA shall be entitled to withhold performance and discontinue Service to you until all amounts due on your account (including, but not limited to, your License Fee) are paid in full.\n\n\n7.  Customer Content and Conduct.\n\n7.1  License; Warranty.  You grant BCMI Labs SA a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free and fully paid license (a) to use the Customer Content in conjunction with the Service; and (b) to use your trademarks, service marks, and logos as required to provide the Service. All rights in and to the Customer Content not expressly granted to BCMI Labs SA in these Terms are reserved by you.\n\n\n7.2  Content and Conduct. You represent and warrant that any Customer Content shall not (a) infringe any copyright, trademark, or patent; (b) misappropriate any trade secret; (c) be deceptive, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, invasive of another’s privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable; (d) contain any viruses, worms or other malicious computer programming codes able to damage the Service, any Content, or other data of the Service; or (e) otherwise violate the rights of a third party. In addition, you agree not to use, or encourage or permit others to use, the Site or Service to (i) stalk and/or harass another; (ii) harm minors in any way; (iii) impersonate any person or entity, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity; (iv) forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers to disguise the origin of any Content posted on or transmitted through the Service; (v) use the Site, Service or Content such that it will mislead a third party into believing that he or she is interacting directly with BCMI Labs SA or the Service; (vi) engage in any chain letters contests, junk e-mail, pyramid schemes, spamming, surveys or other duplicative or unsolicited messages (commercial or otherwise); (vii) use any BCMI Labs SA domain name as a pseudonymous return e-mail address; (viii) access or use the Site or Service in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden or impair any BCMI Labs SA server or the networks connected to any BCMI Labs SA server; or (ix) market any goods or services for any business purposes (including advertising and making offers to buy or sell goods or services), unless specifically allowed to do so by BCMI Labs SA. You will defend at your expense any suit brought against BCMI Labs SA and will pay any settlement you make or approve or any damages finally awarded in such suit insofar as such suit is based on a claim by any third party based upon, resulting from or related to any improper or unauthorized use of the Service by you or any Customer Content.\n\n\n7.3  Storage; Security and Backups. BCMI Labs SA reserves the right to establish capacity limits on your storage of Customer Content on the Service. BCMI Labs SA shall provide logical and physical security to ensure the logical and physical security of its equipment and Customer Content. The logical and physical security provided by BCMI Labs SA will include, but not be limited to (a) a defined security administration practice and process including account and password administration; and (b) ensuring that only authorized BCMI Labs SA employees and contractors who have a need for physical access to provide the Service will have such access to the equipment and Customer Content. During the Term, BCMI Labs SA shall use commercially reasonable efforts to protect Customer Content behind a secure firewall system, to conduct daily data backups, and to store weekly full-system backups in a separate, fire-resistant facility.\n\n\n7.4  Content Loss.  You represent and warrant that you shall keep and maintain your own copy of all Project Content that is provided to the Service and BCMI Labs SA. Except as set forth below, BCMI Labs SA is not obligated to back up any Project Content that is posted on the Service. BCMI Labs SA therefore recommends that you create backup copies of any Project Content posted on the Service at your sole cost and expense. You agree that any use of the Service contrary to or in violation of your representations and warranties in this section constitutes improper and unauthorized use of the Service. You agree that BCMI Labs SA may (but has no obligation to), in BCMI Labs SA’s sole discretion, remove or modify any Project Content which it deems to violate your representations and warranties in this section. In the event of a loss of Project Content caused by BCMI Labs SA, BCMI Labs SA will use commercially reasonable efforts to recover the Project Content within ninety-six (96) hours of notification of loss. If BCMI Labs SA performs recovery services for a loss of Customer Content not caused by BCMI Labs SA, you agree to pay BCMI Labs SA’s then-current time and materials rate to attempt to recover the Project Content. The foregoing constitutes your sole and exclusive remedy for any loss of Customer Content.\n\n\n7.5  Access to Project Content on Termination.  In the event your access to the Service is terminated (other than by reason of your breach), BCMI Labs SA will make available to you a file of the Project Content if requested in writing by you within thirty (30) days after such termination. You agree and acknowledge that BCMI Labs SA has no obligation to retain the Project Content, and may delete such Project Content, at any time on or after the thirty-first (31st) day following termination. BCMI Labs SA reserves the right to withhold, remove and/or discard Project Content, without notice, for any breach, including, without limitation, your non-payment. Upon termination for cause, your right to access or use Project Content shall immediately cease, and BCMI Labs SA will have no obligation to maintain or provide any Project Content.\n\n\n8.  Third Party Links.\n\nThe Site may contain links to other web sites operated by third parties. Such third party web sites are not under the control of BCMI Labs SA. BCMI Labs SA is not responsible for the content of any third party web site or any link contained in a third party web site. BCMI Labs SA provides these links only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to third party web sites.\n\n\n\n9.  Copyright Policy.\n\nBCMI Labs SA reserves the right to terminate its agreement with any User about whom BCMI Labs SA receives copyright infringement notifications in accordance with this Section 10. Without limiting the foregoing, if you believe that a copyrighted work has been copied and posted via the Service in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you shall provide BCMI Labs SA with the following information: (a) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyrighted work; (b) an identification and location in connection with the Service of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; (c) a written statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the owner, its agent, or the law; (d) your name and contact information, such as telephone number or e-mail address; and (e) a statement by you that the above information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf. Contact information for BCMI Labs SA’s Copyright Agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement is as follows:\n\n\nBCMI Labs SA \nCorso San Gottardo 6a\n6830 Chiasso\nSwitzerland\nadmin.ch@bcmi-labs.cc     \n\n\n\n10. Warranties.\n\n10.1  Limited Warranty. BCMI Labs SA warrants that it will provide the Service in a manner consistent with general industry standards reasonably applicable to the provision thereof and that the Service will materially conform to BCMI Labs SA’s then current Documentation for the Service under normal use and circumstances. If you notify BCMI Labs SA of a breach of warranty, BCMI Labs SA will correct or modify the Service so that it conforms to BCMI Labs SA’s then current Documentation for the Service. The foregoing constitutes your sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of warranty.\n\n\n10.2  Disclaimer. The limited warranty set forth in these Terms is made for your benefit only. Except as expressly provided in this section and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Service and any other services provided by BCMI Labs SA are provided “as is,” and BCMI Labs SA makes no (and hereby disclaims all) warranties, representations, or conditions, whether written, oral, express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability, title, noninfringement, or fitness for a particular purpose, with respect to the use, misuse, or inability to use the Service (in whole or in part) or any other products or services provided to you by BCMI Labs SA. BCMI Labs SA does not warrant that all errors can be corrected, or that operation of the Service shall be uninterrupted or error-free.\n\n\n10.3  Internet Delays. The Service may be subject to limitations, delays, and other problems inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications. BCMI Labs SA is not responsible for any delays, delivery failures or other damages resulting from such problems.\n\n\n(III) any content obtained from the Service; and\n\n\n(IV) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.\n\n\n11.  Limitation of Liability.\n\n11.1  Types of Damages. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, in no event shall BCMI Labs SA, or its suppliers, be liable to you for any special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages or any lost profits, including any such damages or costs due to loss of data, use or goodwill, personal or property damage resulting from or in connection with BCMI Labs SA’s performance hereunder or the use, misuse, or inability to use the Service or other products or services hereunder, regardless of the cause of action or the theory of liability, whether in tort, contract, or otherwise, even if BCMI Labs SA has been notified of the likelihood of such damages. In no event shall BCMI Labs SA be liable for procurement costs of substitute products or services.\n\n\n11.2  Amount of Damages. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the maximum liability of BCMI Labs SA arising out of or in any way connected to these Terms shall not exceed the fees paid by you to BCMI Labs SA during the Twelve (12) months immediately preceding the claim. The existence of one or more claims under these Terms will not increase BCMI Labs SA’s liability. In no event shall BCMI Labs SA’s suppliers have any liability arising out of or in any way connected to these Terms.\n\n\n11.3  Basis of the Bargain. The parties agree that the limitations of liability set forth in this section shall survive and continue in full force and effect despite any failure of consideration or of an exclusive remedy. The parties acknowledge that the prices have been set and the Terms entered into in reliance upon these limitations of liability and that all such limitations form an essential basis of the bargain between the parties.\n\n\n11.4  Additional Rights. Certain states and/or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental, consequential or certain other types of damages, so the exclusions set forth above may not apply to you.\n\n\n\n12.  Indemnification.\n\n12.1  By BCMI Labs SA. BCMI Labs SA will defend at its expense any suit brought against you, and will pay any settlement BCMI Labs SA makes or approves, or any damages finally awarded in such suit, insofar as such suit is based on a claim by any third party alleging that the Service misappropriates any trade secret recognized under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act or infringes any United States copyright. If any portion of the Service becomes, or in BCMI Labs SA’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, BCMI Labs SA may, at BCMI Labs SA’s option: (a) procure for you the right to continue using the Service; (b) replace the Service with non-infringing services which do not materially impair the functionality of the Service; (c) modify the Service so that it becomes non-infringing; or (d) terminate the Service and refund any fees actually paid by you to BCMI Labs SA for the remainder of the License Term then in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, BCMI Labs SA shall have no obligation under this section or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon (w) any use of the Service not in accordance with these Terms or the Documentation; (x) BCMI Labs SA’s conformance to your specifications; (y) any use of the Service in combination with other products, equipment, software or Content not supplied by BCMI Labs SA; or (z) any modification of the Service by any person other than BCMI Labs SA or its authorized agents. This subsection states your sole and exclusive remedy for infringement claims and actions.                \n\n\n12.2  Procedure. The indemnifying party’s obligations as set forth above are expressly conditioned upon each of the following: (a) the indemnified party shall promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of any threatened or actual claim or suit; (b) the indemnifying party shall have sole control of the defense or settlement of any claim or suit; and (c) the indemnified party shall cooperate with the indemnifying party to facilitate the settlement or defense of any claim or suit.   \n\n\n\n13.  Termination.\n\n13.1  Term. These Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or BCMI Labs SA as set forth below (the “Term”).  \n\n\n13.2  Termination by You.  If you want to terminate your agreement with BCMI Labs SA, you may do so by (a) notifying BCMI Labs SA at any time; and (b) closing your account for the Service, where BCMI Labs SA has made this option available to you. Your notice should be sent, in writing, to BCMI Labs SA’s address set forth below.   \n\n\n13.3  Termination by BCMI Labs SA. BCMI Labs SA may at any time terminate these Terms if (a) you or any of your Named Users have breached any provision of these Terms (or have acted in a manner that clearly shows you do not intend to, or are unable to, comply with these Terms); (b) BCMI Labs SA is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Site or Service to you is, or becomes, unlawful); (c) the provision of the Service to you by BCMI Labs SA is, in BCMI Labs SA’s opinion, no longer commercially viable; or (d) BCMI Labs SA has elected to discontinue the Site or the Service (or any part thereof).  \n\n\n13.4  Effect of Termination. Termination of your account includes: (a) removal of access to all offerings within the Service; (b) deletion of your password and all related information; and (c) barring of further use of the Service. Upon expiration or termination, you shall promptly discontinue use of the Site and the Service. However, Sections 5.6 (IP Ownership), 6 (Payment), 7.1 (License; Warranty), 7.4 (Content Loss), 8 (Third Party Links), 11 (Limited Warranty and Disclaimer), 12 (Limitation of Liability), 13 (Indemnification), 14 (Termination) and 15 (Miscellaneous) of these Terms will survive any termination of the Terms.  \n\n\n\n14.  User Disputes.\n\nYour interactions with other Users found on or through the Service are solely between you and such other Users.  If there is a dispute between you and any third party (including, without limitation, any User), BCMI Labs SA is under no obligation to become involved; however, we reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users.   \n\n\n\n15.  Miscellaneous\n\n15.1  Governing Law. To the fullest extent permitted by law, and except as explicitly provided otherwise, these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to it will be governed by the laws of the state of California, in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of any other jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms. The laws of the jurisdiction where you are located may be different from California law. You shall always comply with all international and domestic laws, ordinances, regulations, and statutes that are applicable to your purchase and use of the Service hereunder.   \n\n\n15.2  Arbitration.  If you and we have a disagreement related to the Service or the validity of these Terms, we’ll try to resolve it by talking with each other. If we can’t resolve it that way, we both agree to use confidential binding arbitration, not lawsuits (except for small claims court cases) to resolve the dispute. We agree that any controversy or claim between us will be settled by one neutral arbitrator before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). There’s no judge or jury in arbitration, arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court, and review is limited. But you are entitled to a hearing and the arbitrator’s decisions are as enforceable as any court order.    \n\n\n(a)  Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. As modified by these terms of conditions of use, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively “Rules and Procedures”). We further agree that: (i) the arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and us; (ii) any claims brought by you or us must be brought in our individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding; (iii) the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding; (iv) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; (v) we also reserve the right in our sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (vi) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; and (g) a decision by the arbitrator (including any finding of fact and/or conclusion of law) against either you or us shall be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law or by any administrative body.    \n\n\n(b)  With the exception of subparts (ii) and (iii) in the paragraph above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained in these terms of conditions of use. If, however, either subpart (ii) or (iii) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither your or we shall be entitled to arbitration, and the provision below titled “Forum and Jurisdiction” will apply.    \n\n\n(c)  For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879, write the AAA at 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, New York 10019, or visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org.   \n\n\n15.3  Forum and Jurisdiction: You and BCMI Labs SA agree that (i) claims for infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret (including injunctive remedies or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief for asserted violation or threatened violation of intellectual property rights), (ii) claims for interim equitable relief in court in order to maintain the status quo pending the arbitrator’s ruling, and (iii) if this subparts (ii) and (iii) in Section 15.2(a) are held unenforceable or any claims, demands, or disputes are initiated, filed, or proceed in court rather than in arbitration for whatever reason, such claims, demands, or disputes shall be exclusively resolved by an appropriate federal or state court located in the County of San Mateo, California. You and BCMI Labs SA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in the County of San Mateo, California for such purpose.    \n\n\n15.4  Export. You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from BCMI Labs SA, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.    \n\n\n15.5  Severability.  If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will remain enforceable and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree that Section 12 (Limitation of Liability) will remain in effect notwithstanding the unenforceability of any provision in Section 11 (Limited Warranty and Disclaimer). \n\n\n15.6  Waiver. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of these Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.  \n\n\n15.7  Release.  You hereby release and forever discharge us (and our officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns) from, and hereby waive and relinquish, each and every past, present and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature (including personal injuries, death, and property damage), that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of, or relates directly or indirectly to, any interactions with, or act or omission of, other Users. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542 in connection with the foregoing, which states: “a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”  \n\n\n15.8  Remedies. The parties acknowledge that any actual or threatened breach of Section 5 (License Grant and Restrictions) will constitute immediate, irreparable harm to the non-breaching party for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy for such breach. If any legal action is brought to enforce these Terms, the prevailing party will be entitled to receive its attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other collection expenses, in addition to any other relief it may receive.   \n\n\n15.9  No Assignment. You will not assign, subcontract, delegate, or otherwise transfer these Terms, or its rights and obligations herein, without obtaining the prior written consent of BCMI Labs SA, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void; provided, however, that you may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of you assets, or other operation of law, without any consent of BCMI Labs SA. These Terms shall be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.  \n\n\n15.10  Force Majeure. Any delay in the performance of any duties or obligations of either party (except the payment of money owed) will not be considered a breach of these Terms if such delay is caused by a labor dispute, shortage of materials, fire, earthquake, flood, or any other event beyond the control of such party, provided that such party uses reasonable efforts, under the circumstances, to notify the other party of the cause of such delay and to resume performance as soon as possible.   \n\n\n15.11  Independent Contractors. Your relationship to BCMI Labs SA is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. You will not have, and will not represent to any third party that you have, any authority to act on behalf of BCMI Labs SA.  \n\n\n15.12  Use of name and logo. You hereby grant BCMI Labs SA the right to use your name and logo to identify you as a customer of BCMI Labs SA in materials promoting the Service. You may request that we cease further use of your name and logo in newly created materials at any time by submitting a written request via email to [admin.ch@bcmi-labs.cc] requesting to be excluded from such materials.

You represent and warrant that you shall keep and maintain your own copy of all Project Content that is provided to the Service and BCMI Labs SA.

BCMI Labs SA warrants that it will provide the Service in a manner consistent with general industry standards reasonably applicable to the provision thereof and that the Service will materially conform to BCMI Labs SA’s then current Documentation for the Service under normal use and circumstances. If you notify BCMI Labs SA of a breach of warranty, BCMI Labs SA will correct or modify the Service so that it conforms to BCMI Labs SA’s then current Documentation for the Service. The foregoing constitutes your sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of warranty.</p><p>10.2 Disclaimer. The limited warranty set forth in these Terms is made for your benefit only. Except as expressly provided in this section and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Service and any other services provided by BCMI Labs SA are provided “as is,” and BCMI Labs SA makes no (and hereby disclaims all) warranties, representations, or conditions, whether written, oral, express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability, title, noninfringement, or fitness for a particular purpose, with respect to the use, misuse, or inability to use the Service (in whole or in part) or any other products or services provided to you by BCMI Labs SA. BCMI Labs SA does not warrant that all errors can be corrected, or that operation of the Service shall be uninterrupted or error-free.</p><p>10.3 Internet Delays. The Service may be subject to limitations, delays, and other problems inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications. BCMI Labs SA is not responsible for any delays, delivery failures or other damages resulting from such problems.</p><p><strong>(III)</strong> any content obtained from the Service; and</p><p><strong>(IV)</strong> unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p><h3>11. Limitation of Liability.</h3><p>11.1 Types of Damages. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, in no event shall BCMI Labs SA, or its suppliers, be liable to you for any special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages or any lost profits, including any such damages or costs due to loss of data, use or goodwill, personal or property damage resulting from or in connection with BCMI Labs SA’s performance hereunder or the use, misuse, or inability to use the Service or other products or services hereunder, regardless of the cause of action or the theory of liability, whether in tort, contract, or otherwise, even if BCMI Labs SA has been notified of the likelihood of such damages. In no event shall BCMI Labs SA be liable for procurement costs of substitute products or services.</p><p>11.2 Amount of Damages. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the maximum liability of BCMI Labs SA arising out of or in any way connected to these Terms shall not exceed the fees paid by you to BCMI Labs SA during the Twelve (12) months immediately preceding the claim. The existence of one or more claims under these Terms will not increase BCMI Labs SA’s liability. In no event shall BCMI Labs SA’s suppliers have any liability arising out of or in any way connected to these Terms.</p><p>11.3 Basis of the Bargain. The parties agree that the limitations of liability set forth in this section shall survive and continue in full force and effect despite any failure of consideration or of an exclusive remedy. The parties acknowledge that the prices have been set and the Terms entered into in reliance upon these limitations of liability and that all such limitations form an essential basis of the bargain between the parties.</p><p>11.4 Additional Rights. Certain states and/or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental, consequential or certain other types of damages, so the exclusions set forth above may not apply to you.</p><h3>12. Indemnification.</h3><p>12.1 By BCMI Labs SA. BCMI Labs SA will defend at its expense any suit brought against you, and will pay any settlement BCMI Labs SA makes or approves, or any damages finally awarded in such suit, insofar as such suit is based on a claim by any third party alleging that the Service misappropriates any trade secret recognized under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act or infringes any United States copyright. If any portion of the Service becomes, or in BCMI Labs SA’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, BCMI Labs SA may, at BCMI Labs SA’s option: (a) procure for you the right to continue using the Service; (b) replace the Service with non-infringing services which do not materially impair the functionality of the Service; (c) modify the Service so that it becomes non-infringing; or (d) terminate the Service and refund any fees actually paid by you to BCMI Labs SA for the remainder of the License Term then in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, BCMI Labs SA shall have no obligation under this section or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon (w) any use of the Service not in accordance with these Terms or the Documentation; (x) BCMI Labs SA’s conformance to your specifications; (y) any use of the Service in combination with other products, equipment, software or Content not supplied by BCMI Labs SA; or (z) any modification of the Service by any person other than BCMI Labs SA or its authorized agents.

The indemnifying party’s obligations as set forth above are expressly conditioned upon each of the following: (a) the indemnified party shall promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of any threatened or actual claim or suit; (b) the indemnifying party shall have sole control of the defense or settlement of any claim or suit; and (c) the indemnified party shall cooperate with the indemnifying party to facilitate the settlement or defense of any claim or suit.</p><h3>13. Termination.</h3><p>13.1 Term. These Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or BCMI Labs SA as set forth below (the “Term”).</p><p>13.2 Termination by You. If you want to terminate your agreement with BCMI Labs SA, you may do so by (a) notifying BCMI Labs SA at any time; and (b) closing your account for the Service, where BCMI Labs SA has made this option available to you. Your notice should be sent, in writing, to BCMI Labs SA’s address set forth below.</p><p>13.3 Termination by BCMI Labs SA. BCMI Labs SA may at any time terminate these Terms if (a) you or any of your Named Users have breached any provision of these Terms (or have acted in a manner that clearly shows you do not intend to, or are unable to, comply with these Terms); (b) BCMI Labs SA is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Site or Service to you is, or becomes, unlawful); (c) the provision of the Service to you by BCMI Labs SA is, in BCMI Labs SA’s opinion, no longer commercially viable; or (d) BCMI Labs SA has elected to discontinue the Site or the Service (or any part thereof).</p><p>13.4 Effect of Termination. Termination of your account includes: (a) removal of access to all offerings within the Service; (b) deletion of your password and all related information; and (c) barring of further use of the Service. Upon expiration or termination, you shall promptly discontinue use of the Site and the Service. However, Sections 5.6 (IP Ownership), 6 (Payment), 7.1 (License; Warranty), 7.4 (Content Loss), 8 (Third Party Links), 11 (Limited Warranty and Disclaimer), 12 (Limitation of Liability), 13 (Indemnification), 14 (Termination) and 15 (Miscellaneous) of these Terms will survive any termination of the Terms.</p><h3>14. User Disputes.</h3><p>Your interactions with other Users found on or through the Service are solely between you and such other Users. If there is a dispute between you and any third party (including, without limitation, any User), BCMI Labs SA is under no obligation to become involved; however, we reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users.</p><h3>15. Miscellaneous</h3><p>15.1 Governing Law. To the fullest extent permitted by law, and except as explicitly provided otherwise, these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to it will be governed by the laws of the state of California, in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of any other jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms. The laws of the jurisdiction where you are located may be different from California law. You shall always comply with all international and domestic laws, ordinances, regulations, and statutes that are applicable to your purchase and use of the Service hereunder.</p><p>15.2 Arbitration. If you and we have a disagreement related to the Service or the validity of these Terms, we’ll try to resolve it by talking with each other. If we can’t resolve it that way, we both agree to use confidential binding arbitration, not lawsuits (except for small claims court cases) to resolve the dispute. We agree that any controversy or claim between us will be settled by one neutral arbitrator before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). There’s no judge or jury in arbitration, arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court, and review is limited. But you are entitled to a hearing and the arbitrator’s decisions are as enforceable as any court order.</p><p>(a) Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. As modified by these terms of conditions of use, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively “Rules and Procedures”). We further agree that: (i) the arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and us; (ii) any claims brought by you or us must be brought in our individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding; (iii) the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding; (iv) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; (v) we also reserve the right in our sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (vi) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; and (g) a decision by the arbitrator (including any finding of fact and/or conclusion of law) against either you or us shall be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law or by any administrative body.</p><p>(b) With the exception of subparts (ii) and (iii) in the paragraph above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained in these terms of conditions of use. If, however, either subpart (ii) or (iii) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither your or we shall be entitled to arbitration, and the provision below titled “Forum and Jurisdiction” will apply.</p><p>(c) For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879, write the AAA at 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, New York 10019, or visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org.</p><p>15.3 Forum and Jurisdiction: You and BCMI Labs SA agree that (i) claims for infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret (including injunctive remedies or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief for asserted violation or threatened violation of intellectual property rights), (ii) claims for interim equitable relief in court in order to maintain the status quo pending the arbitrator’s ruling, and (iii) if this subparts (ii) and (iii) in Section 15.2(a) are held unenforceable or any claims, demands, or disputes are initiated, filed, or proceed in court rather than in arbitration for whatever reason, such claims, demands, or disputes shall be exclusively resolved by an appropriate federal or state court located in the County of San Mateo, California. You and BCMI Labs SA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in the County of San Mateo, California for such purpose.</p><p>15.4 Export. You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from BCMI Labs SA, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.</p><p>15.5 Severability. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will remain enforceable and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree that Section 12 (Limitation of Liability) will remain in effect notwithstanding the unenforceability of any provision in Section 11 (Limited Warranty and Disclaimer).</p><p>15.6 Waiver. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of these Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.</p><p>15.7 Release. You hereby release and forever discharge us (and our officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns) from, and hereby waive and relinquish, each and every past, present and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature (including personal injuries, death, and property damage), that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of, or relates directly or indirectly to, any interactions with, or act or omission of, other Users. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542 in connection with the foregoing, which states: “a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</p><p>15.8 Remedies. The parties acknowledge that any actual or threatened breach of Section 5 (License Grant and Restrictions) will constitute immediate, irreparable harm to the non-breaching party for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy for such breach. If any legal action is brought to enforce these Terms, the prevailing party will be entitled to receive its attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other collection expenses, in addition to any other relief it may receive.</p><p>15.9 No Assignment. You will not assign, subcontract, delegate, or otherwise transfer these Terms, or its rights and obligations herein, without obtaining the prior written consent of BCMI Labs SA, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void; provided, however, that you may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of you assets, or other operation of law, without any consent of BCMI Labs SA. These Terms shall be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p><p>15.10 Force Majeure. Any delay in the performance of any duties or obligations of either party (except the payment of money owed) will not be considered a breach of these Terms if such delay is caused by a labor dispute, shortage of materials, fire, earthquake, flood, or any other event beyond the control of such party, provided that such party uses reasonable efforts, under the circumstances, to notify the other party of the cause of such delay and to resume performance as soon as possible.</p><p>15.11 Independent Contractors. Your relationship to BCMI Labs SA is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. You will not have, and will not represent to any third party that you have, any authority to act on behalf of BCMI Labs SA.</p><p>15.12 Use of name and logo. You hereby grant BCMI Labs SA the right to use your name and logo to identify you as a customer of BCMI Labs SA in materials promoting the Service. You may request that we cease further use of your name and logo in newly created materials at any time by submitting a written request via email to [admin.ch@bcmi-labs.cc] requesting to be excluded from such materials. BCMI Labs SA will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor such request within thirty (30) calendar days after BCMI Labs SA’s receipt of such request unless such request is received by BCMI Labs SA less than five (5) business days following the date you enter into these Terms, in which case such request will be effective immediately upon receipt by BCMI Labs SA.</p><p>15.13 Notices. You are responsible for updating your data to provide BCMI Labs SA with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you have provided to BCMI Labs SA is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required by these Terms, BCMI Labs SA’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described on the notice. Any notice provided to BCMI Labs SA pursuant to these Terms should be sent to [admin.ch@bcmi-labs.cc].</p><p>15.14 Entire Agreement. These Terms are the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matters hereof and supersede and merge all prior discussions between the parties with respect to such subject matters. No modification of or amendment to these Terms, or any waiver of any rights under these Terms, will be effective unless in writing.</p><h3>CONTACT US</h3><p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at support@arduino.cc<br><br><br></p></div></div></div></div>'),
